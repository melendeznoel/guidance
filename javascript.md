# JavaScript

## **1\. Is Javascript single-threaded?**

Yes, **JavaScript is** a **single-threaded language**. This means that it has **only one call stack and one memory heap
**. Only one set of instructions is executed at a time.

Also, **Javascript is Synchronous and blocking** in nature. meaning that code is executed line by line and one task must
be completed before the next one begins

**However**, JavaScript also has asynchronous capabilities, which allow certain operations to be executed independently
of
the main execution thread. This is commonly achieved through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, async/await, and event
listeners. These asynchronous features enable JavaScript to handle tasks such as fetching data, handling user input, and
performing I/O operations without blocking the main thread, making it suitable for building responsive and interactive
web applications.

## **2\. Explain the main component of the JavaScript Engine and how it works**

Every browser has a Javascript engine that executes the javascript code and converts it into machine code.

When JavaScript code is executed, the parser first reads the code and produces an **AST**, and stores it in memory. The
interpreter then processes this AST and generates **bytecode** or machine code, which is executed by the computer.

The profiler is a component of a JavaScript engine that **monitors** the execution of the code.

**Bytecode** is used by optimizing the compiler along with profiling data. ‚ÄùOptimizing compiler‚Äù or Just-in-time (JIT)
compiler makes certain assumptions based on profiling data and produces highly optimized machine code.

Sometimes there is a case where the ‚Äòoptimization‚Äô assumption is incorrect and then it goes back to the previous version
via the ‚ÄúDeoptimize‚Äù phase (where it actually becomes the overhead to us)

JS Engine usually optimizes ‚Äúhot functions‚Äù and uses inline caching techniques to optimize the code.

During this process, **the call stack keeps track of the currently executing functions, and the memory heap is used for
memory allocation**.

Finally, the garbage collector comes into play to manage memory by reclaiming memory from unused objects.

**Google Chrome ùó©ùü¥ Engine:**

1. Interpreter is called **‚ÄúIgnition‚Äù**.
2. Optimizing compiler is called **‚ÄúTurboFan‚Äù**.
3. Apart from Parser, there is a ‚Äúpre-parser‚Äù that checks for syntax and tokens
4. ‚Äú**Sparkplug**‚Äù is introduced which is present between ‚ÄúIgnition‚Äù & ‚ÄúTurboFan‚Äù which is also called **Fast Compiler.

The Event loop is a core component of the JavaScript runtime environment. It is **responsible for scheduling and
executing asynchronous tasks**. The event loop works by continuously monitoring two queues: the call stack and the event
queue.

**The call stack** is a **stack(LIFO) data structure** that stores the functions **that are currently being
executed (**stores the execution context created during the code execution**)**.

**Web APIs** is the place where the async operations (setTimeout, fetch requests, promises) with their callbacks are
waiting to complete. **It borrows the thread from the thread pool to complete the task in the background** without
blocking the main thread.

**The job queue (or microtasks)** is a FIFO (First In, First Out) structure that **holds the callbacks of async/await,
promises, process.nextTick()** that are ready to be executed. For example, the resolve or reject callbacks of a
fulfilled promise are enqueued in the job queue.

**The task queue (or macrostasks)** is a FIFO (First In, First Out) structure **that holds the callbacks of async
operations (timer like setInterval, setTimeout)** that are ready to be executed. For example, the callback of a
timed-out `setTimeout()` ‚Äî ready to be executed ‚Äî is enqueued in the task queue.

**The Event loop permanently monitors** whether the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty, the event loop
looks into the job queue or task queue and **dequeues any callback ready to be executed into the call stack.**

In a browser the **window object is the window of the browser**, the top structure in the HTML tree. **Variables
declared with var globally are attached to the window object**. Type _var dog = ‚Äòbowser‚Äô_ in the browser‚Äôs console and
then type _window.dog._ The value ‚Äòbowser‚Äô appears! This makes controlling the scope of the variable even more
difficult. By contrast, **let and const** are not attached to the window object.

## 5\. **Different data types in Javascript?**

**JavaScript is a dynamic and loosely typed, or duck-typed language**. It means that we do not need to specify the type
of variable because the JavaScript engine dynamically determines the data type of a variable based on its values.

Primitive data types in JavaScript are the most basic data types that **represent single values**. **They are
immutable (cannot be changed)** and directly hold a specific value.

In JavaScript, a **Symbol is a primitive data type** introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that **represents a unique and
immutable value**. It is often **used as an identifier for object properties** to avoid name collisions

```javascript
const mySymbol = Symbol('key');
const obj = {
    [mySymbol]: 'value'
};
```

When a Symbol is used as a property key, it doesn‚Äôt clash with other property keys, including string keys.

## **6\. What is callback function and callback hell?**

In JavaScript, callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations.

**Callback function** is a function that is **passed as an argument** to another function and is intended **to be
executed after the completion of a specific task or at a given time.**

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
    // Simulate fetching data from a server  
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = 'Some data from the server';
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

function processData(data) {
    console.log('Processing data:', data);
}

fetchData('https://example.com/data', processData);
```

In this example, the fetchData function takes a URL and a **callback function as arguments**. After fetching the data
from the server (simulated using setTimeout), it calls the callback function and passes the retrieved data to it.

**Callback Hell**, also known as **‚ÄúPyramid of Doom‚Äù** is a term used in JavaScript programming to describe a situation
**where multiple nested callbacks are used within asynchronous functions**.

‚Äú**It occurs when asynchronous operations depend on the results of previous asynchronous operations, resulting in deeply
nested and often hard-to-read code.**‚Äù

Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing
with asynchronous logic.

```javascript
fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8', function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
    } else {
        fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8', function (err, data) {
            if (err) {
                console.error(err);
            } else {
                fs.readFile('file3.txt', 'utf8', function (err, data) {
                    if (err) {
                        console.error(err);
                    } else {
                        // Continue with more nested callbacks...  
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }
});
```

In this example, we‚Äôre reading three files sequentially using the `fs.readFile` function, and each file reading
operation is asynchronous. As a result, we have to nest the callbacks inside one another, creating a pyramid structure
of callbacks.

**To avoid Callback Hell, modern JavaScript provides alternatives like Promises and async/await.** Here‚Äôs the same code
using Promises:

```javascript
  const readFile = (file) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                reject(err);
            } else {
                resolve(data);
            }
        });
    });
};

readFile('file1.txt')
    .then((data1) => {
        return readFile('file2.txt');
    })
    .then((data2) => {
        return readFile('file3.txt');
    })
    .then((data3) => {
        // Continue with more promise-based code...  
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

## **7\. What is Promise and Promise chaining?**

**Promise:** A Promise is **an object in JavaScript** used for asynchronous computations. **It represents the result of
an asynchronous operation, the result may be resolved or rejected.**

Promises have three states:

1. **Pending**: The initial state. This is the state in which the Promise‚Äôs eventual value is not yet available.
2. **Fulfilled**: The state in which the Promise has been resolved successfully, and the eventual value is now
   available.
3. **Rejected**: The state in which the Promise has encountered an error or has been rejected, and the eventual value
   cannot be provided.

**Promise constructor** has two parameters **(resolve, reject)** **which are functions.** If the async task has been
completed without errors then call the **resolve function** with message or fetched data to resolve the promise.

If an error occurred then call the **reject function** and pass the error to it.

we can access the result of promise using .then() handler.

we can catch the error in the .catch() handler.

```javascript
// Creating a Promise  
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulate fetching data from a server  
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = 'Some data from the server';
        // Resolve the Promise with the retrieved data  
        resolve(data);
        // Reject the Promise with an error  
        // reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data'));  
    }, 1000);
});

// Consuming the Promise  
fetchData
    .then((data) => {
        console.log('Data fetched:', data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    });
```

**Promise Chaining:** The process of **executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises** is
known as Promise chaining.

**It involves chaining multiple** `**.then()**` **methods** to a Promise to perform a series of tasks in a specific
order.

```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
})
    .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 1  
        return result * 2;
    })
    .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 2  
        return result * 3;
    })
    .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 6  
        return result * 4;
    });
```

## 8\. What is async/await?

Async/await is a **modern approach** to handling asynchronous code in JavaScript. It provides a more concise and
readable way to work with Promises and async operations, effectively avoiding the ‚ÄúCallback Hell‚Äù and improving the
overall structure of asynchronous code.

In JavaScript, **the async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, which returns a Promise**.

Within an async function, **the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved
**, effectively allowing for synchronous-looking code while working with asynchronous operations.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {  
  try {  
    const data = await fetch('https://example.com/data');  
    const jsonData = await data.json();  
    return jsonData;  
  } catch (error) {  
    throw error;  
  }  
}

// Using the async function  
fetchData()  
  .then((jsonData) => {  
    // Handle the retrieved data  
  })  
  .catch((error) => {  
    // Handle errors  
  });
```

In this example, the fetchData function is defined as an async function, and it uses the await keyword to pause the
execution and wait for the fetch and json operations, effectively working with Promises in a way that resembles
synchronous code.

## 9\. What is the difference between == and === operators?

`**==**` **(Loose Equality Operator):**  This operator **performs type coercion**, which means **it converts the operands
to the same type** before making the comparison. It checks if the values are equal without considering their data types.
For example, `1 == '1'` will return `true` because JavaScript converts the string `'1'` to a number before comparison.

`**===**` **(Strict Equality Operator):**  This operator performs a strict comparison **without type coercion**. It
checks if both the values and their data types are equal. For example, `1 === '1'` will return `false` because the data
types are different (number and string).

In summary, `==` checks for equality after type coercion, whereas `===` checks for strict equality, considering both the
values and their data types.

**Execution of == will be fast as compared to the === statement.**

Some of the example that covers the above cases:

```javascript
0 == false   // true  
0 === false  // false  
1 == "1"     // true  
1 === "1"    // false  
null == undefined // true  
null === undefined // false  
'0' == false // true  
'0' === false // false  
[]==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory  
{}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
```

## **10\. Different ways to create an Object in Javascript?**

In JavaScript, there are several ways to create objects. Some common methods for object creation include:

**a) Object Literals**:  The most straightforward way to create an object is by using object literals, which define an
object‚Äôs properties and methods in a comma-separated list enclosed in curly braces.

```javascript
 let person = {  
       firstName: 'John',  
       lastName: 'Doe',  
       greet: function() {  
           return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
       }  
   };
```

**b) Constructor Function**:  Constructor functions can be used to create multiple instances of an object with the new
keyword. Inside the constructor function, properties and methods can be assigned to the this keyword.

```javascript
 function Person(firstName, lastName) {  
       this.firstName = firstName;  
       this.lastName = lastName;  
       this.greet = function() {  
           return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
       };  
   }  

   let person1 = new Person('John', 'Doe');  
   let person2 = new Person('Jane', 'Smith');
```

**c) Object.create()**:  The Object.create() method allows you to create a new object with a specified prototype object.
This method provides more control over the prototype of the newly created object.

```javascript
 let personProto = {  
       greet: function() {  
           return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
       }  
   };  

   let person = Object.create(personProto);  
   person.firstName = 'John';  
   person.lastName = 'Doe';

```

**d) Class Syntax (ES6)**:  With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript supports class syntax for defining objects using the
class keyword. This provides a more familiar and structured way to create objects and define their properties and
methods.

```javascript
 class Person {  
       constructor(firstName, lastName) {  
           this.firstName = firstName;  
           this.lastName = lastName;  
       }  
       greet() {  
           return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
       }  
   }  

   let person = new Person('John', 'Doe');
```

**e) Factory Functions**:  Factory functions are functions that return an object. This approach allows you to encapsulate
the object creation process and easily create multiple instances with custom properties.

```javascript
 function createPerson(firstName, lastName) {  
       return {  
           firstName: firstName,  
           lastName: lastName,  
           greet: function() {  
               return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
           }  
       };  
   }  

   let person1 = createPerson('John', 'Doe');  
   let person2 = createPerson('Jane', 'Smith');
```

**f) Object.setPrototypeOf()**:  The Object.setPrototypeOf() method can be used to set the prototype of a specified
object. This offers an alternative approach to setting the prototype of an object after its creation.

```javascript
 let personProto = {  
       greet: function() {  
           return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  
       }  
   };  

   let person = {};  
   person.firstName = 'John';  
   person.lastName = 'Doe';  
   Object.setPrototypeOf(person, personProto);
```

**g) Object.assign()**:  The Object.assign() method can be used to create a new object by copying the values of all
enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. This is particularly useful for merging
objects or creating a shallow copy.

```javascript
let target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
let source = { b: 3, c: 4 };
let mergedObject = Object.assign({}, target, source);
```

**h) Prototype Inheritance**:  JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods
from other objects. You can create objects by leveraging prototypal inheritance and using the prototype property of
constructor functions or classes to define shared behavior.

```javascript
 function Animal(name) {  
       this.name = name;  
   }  

   Animal.prototype.greet = function() {  
       return 'Hello, I am ' + this.name;  
   };  

   function Dog(name, breed) {  
       Animal.call(this, name);  
       this.breed = breed;  
   }  

   Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);  
   Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;  

   let myDog = new Dog('Max', 'Poodle');
```

**i) Singleton Pattern**:  The singleton pattern is used to restrict an object to a single instance. It can be implemented
in JavaScript using a combination of **closures** and **[immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression#:~:text=An%20immediately%20invoked%20function%20expression,lexical%20scope%20using%20function%20scoping.)**. This ensures that
only one instance of the object is created.

```javascript
 let singleton = (() => {  
       let instance;  

       function createInstance() {  
           return {  
               // properties and methods  
           };  
       }  

       return {  
           getInstance: () => {  
               if (!instance) {  
                   instance = createInstance();  
               }  
               return instance;  
           }  
       };  
   })();
```

## **11\. What is rest and spread operator?**

The rest operator, represented by three dots (`...`), is used in function parameters **to collect a variable number of
arguments into an array**. It allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function **without explicitly
defining them as named parameters.**

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {  
    return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);  
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Outputs 10
```

**The spread operator**, also denoted by three dots (`...`), is **used to spread the elements of an array or object into
another array or object**. It allows you to easily clone arrays, concatenate arrays, and merge objects.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];  
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];  
const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];  
// mergedArray is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
// mergedObject is { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
```

## **12\. What is a higher-order function?**

Higher-order function in JavaScript is **a function that** **either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns
a function as its result.** In other words, it operates on functions, either by taking them as arguments, returning
them, or both.

```javascript
function operationOnArray(arr, operation) {  
  let result = [];  
  for (let element of arr) {  
    result.push(operation(element));  
  }  
  return result;  
}  

function double(x) {  
  return x * 2;  
}  

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];  
let doubledNumbers = operationOnArray(numbers, double);  
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

They enable powerful techniques such as function composition, currying, and callback-based asynchronous operations.
Understanding higher-order functions is essential for writing expressive and functional-style JavaScript code.

**An unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument.** It stands for a single argument
accepted by a function.

## 13\. **What is Closure? What are the use cases of Closures?**

**Closure** is a feature that allows the function to capture the environment (**or to retain access to variables from
the scope** ) where it is defined, even after that scope has closed.

We can say the closure is a **combination of a function and lexical environment where that function is defined.**

In other words, a closure gives a function access to its own scope, the scope of its outer function, and the global
scope, allowing it to ‚Äúremember‚Äù and continue to access variables and parameters from these scopes.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {  
  let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer function';  

  return innerFunction() {  
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outerVariable from the outer function's scope  
  }  

}  

let myFunction = outerFunction();  
myFunction(); // Output: I am from the outer function
```

**Closure is created every time when a function is created at the time of function creation and when you define a
function inside another function.**

_Execution context is an environment where JavaScript code is executed. For each function call a separate execution
context is created and pushed into the execution stack. Once function execution completed it is popped off from stack._

_Every execution context has a space in memory where its variables and function are stored, and once the function popped
off from the execution stack a JavaScript Garbage collector clear all of these things._

_In JavaScript, anything is garbage-collected only when there are no references to it._

In the above example, the anonymous execution context still has a reference to the variables to the memory space of its
outer environment. Even though the outerFunction() is finished. (It can access the **outerVariabl**e variable and use it
inside console.log(outerVariable)).

Closures have several important use cases in JavaScript:

1. **Data Privacy and Encapsulation**: Closures can be used to create private data and encapsulate functionality within
   a limited scope. By defining functions within another function, the inner functions have access to the outer
   function‚Äôs variables, but these variables are inaccessible from outside the outer function. This allows for the
   creation of private data and methods that are not directly accessible from the outside, thereby enhancing data
   privacy and encapsulation.
2. **Maintaining State**: Closures are often used to maintain state in asynchronous operations and event handling. For
   example, when handling asynchronous tasks, closures can capture and retain the state of variables across multiple
   asynchronous operations, ensuring that the correct variables are accessed when the asynchronous tasks complete.
3. **Currying and Partial Application**: Closures facilitate functional programming techniques such as currying and
   partial application. By using closures to capture and remember specific parameters and return a new function that
   uses these captured parameters, currying and partial application can be achieved. This allows for the creation of
   specialized functions with pre-set arguments, providing flexibility and reusability.
4. **Module Pattern**: Closures are essential in implementing the module pattern in JavaScript. By using closures to
   create private variables and expose only the necessary public methods, developers can create modular and organized
   code, preventing unwanted access and modification of internal module data.
5. **Callback Functions**: Closures are often employed when working with callback functions. A closure can be used to
   capture and maintain the state of variables within the context of an asynchronous operation, ensuring that the
   correct variables are accessible when the callback function is invoked.

## 14\. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript

Hoisting in JavaScript is the **default behavior** where variable and function **declarations are moved to the top of
their containing scope** during the **compilation phase, before the actual code execution**. This means that you can use
a variable or call a function before it‚Äôs declared in your code.

When you declare a variable using `var`, the declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing function or block and *
*initialized with the default value of ‚Äúundefined‚Äù.**

```javascript
console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined

var x = 5;
```

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted as well but have a "temporal dead zone" where they cannot be
accessed before their declaration.

```javascript
console.log(x); // Throws an error (ReferenceError)

let x = 5;
```

Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their containing scope. You can call a function before it‚Äôs
declared in your code.

```javascript
sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello, world!"

function sayHello() {  
    console.log("Hello, world!");  
}

```

**Hoisting is not happening with an arrow function, function expression, or variable initialization.**

## 15\. What is a Temporal dead zone?

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept in JavaScript related to variable declarations using `let` and `const`.

When you declare a variable with `let` or `const`, it is hoisted to the top of its containing scope, However,
unlike `var`, variables declared with `let` and `const` remain uninitialized in the TDZ.

Any attempt to access or use the variable before its actual declaration within the scope will result in
a `ReferenceError`. This is to prevent the use of variables before they have been properly defined.

Understanding the Temporal Dead Zone is important because it helps prevent bugs related to variable usage before
initialization. It also promotes best practices in JavaScript coding by encouraging proper variable declarations before
use.

## **16\. What is a prototype chain?** and Object.create() method?

**In JavaScript, every function and object has a property named prototype by default.**

Every object in JavaScript has a prototype. A prototype is another object from which the current object inherits
properties and methods. You can think of the prototype as a template or a parent object.

**The prototype chain is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects**

When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If it doesn‚Äôt
find it, it looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or method. This process continues until it reaches
the `Object.prototype` at the top of the chain.

## **17\. What is the difference between Call, Apply, and Bind methods?**

**Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a specified `this` value and **individual arguments passed as
comma-separated values**

```javascript
 const person1 = { name: 'John' };  
   const person2 = { name: 'Jane' };  

   function greet(greeting) {  
       console.log(greeting + ' ' + this.name);  
   }  

   greet.call(person1, 'Hello'); // Output: Hello John  
   greet.call(person2, 'Hi'); // Output: Hi Jane
```

With call() method an object can use a method belonging to another object.

```javascript
const o1 = {  
  name: 'ravi',  
  getName: function(){  
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`)  
  }  
}  

const o2 = {  
  name: 'JavaScript Centric'  
}

o1.getName.call(o2) // Hello, JavaScript Centric
```

**Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value but **it accepts arguments as an array.** It is useful when
the number of arguments to be passed is not known in advance or when the arguments are already in an array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);  

console.log(max); // Output: 5
```

**bind:** instead of invoking it returns a new function and allows you to pass any number of arguments. bind() method
takes an object as first argument and create a new function.

```javascript
const module = {  
       x: 42,  
       getX: function() {  
           return this.x;  
       }  
   };

const boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module);  

console.log(boundGetX()); // Output: 42
```

## **18\. What are lambda or arrow functions?**

There are two types of functions in JavaScript

1. Regular Functions
2. Arrow Functions (Introduced in **ES6**)

**Regular Function:** We can write the regular function in two ways, i.e. **Function declaration,** and **Function
expression.**

```javascript
// Function declaration
function add(a, b) {
   return a + b;
}

// Function expression
const sum = function (a, b) {
   return a + b;
}

add(2, 3); // 5
sum(2, 3); // 5
```

**Arrow or Fat Arrow Function: Lambda functions, also known as arrow functions**, are a feature introduced in
JavaScript (ES6) that is a more concise syntax for writing **function expressions.** They have a shorter syntax compared
to traditional function expressions and are **particularly useful for creating anonymous functions** and working with
functional programming concepts.

There is no declaration approach here, we can write by using Function expressions only.

```javascript
// arrow function expression
const add = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
}

// very simple and concise syntax
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

There are certain differences between Arrow and Regular function, i.e

1. Syntax
2. No arguments **(arguments are array-like objects)**
3. No prototype object for the **Arrow function**
4. Cannot be invoked with a new keyword **(Not a constructor function)**
5. No own this **(call, apply & bind won‚Äôt work as expected)**
6. It cannot be used as a **Generator function**
7. Duplicate-named parameters are not allowed

## 19\. What is the currying function?

**Currying is a technique** in functional programming **that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series
of functions, each taking a single argument.** These curried functions can be composed together to build more complex
functions.

In JavaScript, **you can implement currying using closures and returning functions.**

```javascript
// Regular function taking two arguments
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

// Curried version of the function
function curryAdd(x) {
   return function(y) {
      return x + y;
   };
}

const add5 = curryAdd(5); // Partial application, creates a new function

console.log(add5(3)); // Output: 8
```

Currying is beneficial in functional programming and can make code more modular and reusable. It‚Äôs particularly useful
in scenarios where you want to create functions with a varying number of arguments or build pipelines of data
transformations.

## **20\. What are the features of ES6?**

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features and enhancements to JavaScript, significantly
expanding the language‚Äôs capabilities. Some key features of ES6 include:

1. **Arrow Functions**
2. **Block-Scoped Variables**
3. **Classes**
4. **Modules**
5. **Template Literals**: Template literals allow for embedding expressions and multi-line strings using backticks,
   providing a more convenient way to create complex strings in JavaScript.
6. **Default Parameters**
7. **Rest and Spread Operators**
8. **Destructuring Assignment**
9. **Promises**
10. **Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet**: ES6 introduced new built-in data structures, such as Map and Set, for more efficient
    and specialized handling of collections and key-value pairs.
11. **Iterators and Generators**
12. **Enhanced Object Literals**

## **21\. What is Execution context, execution stack, variable object, and scope chain?**

**Execution Context:** the execution context refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It consists
of the scope, variable object, and the value of the ‚Äúthis‚Äù keyword.

Whenever a function is executed, an execution context is created and it contains all the variables or properties of that
function.

There are three types of execution context in JavaScript:

> **Global Execution Context**

> **Functional Execution Context**

> **Eval Function Execution Context**

**Execution Stack:** It is also known as the ‚Äú**call stack**,‚Äù a **LIFO** (Last in, First out) data structure that stores
all the execution context of the function calls that are in progress. When a function is called, a new execution context
is created and pushed onto the stack. When the function completes, its context is popped off the stack.

The engine executes the function whose execution context is at the top of the stack. When this function completes, its
execution stack is popped off from the stack, and the control reaches the context below it in the current stack.

The execution context is created during the creation phase. The following things happen during the creation phase:

1. **LexicalEnvironment** component is created.
2. **VariableEnvironment** component is created.

**Variable Object:** It is a part of the execution context that contains all the variables, function declarations, and
arguments defined in that context.

**Scope Chain:** The scope chain is a mechanism for resolving the value of a variable in JavaScript. When a variable is
referenced, the JavaScript engine looks for the variable first in the current execution context‚Äôs variable object. If
it‚Äôs not found there, it continues to the next outer execution context, following the scope chain, until it finds the
variable or reaches the global execution context.

## **22\. What is the priority of execution of callback, promise, setTimeout, process.nextTick()?**

The priority of execution can be understood based on the event loop and the order in which different asynchronous
operations are handled:

1. **process.nextTick():** Callbacks scheduled using `process.nextTick()` have the highest priority. When you
   use `process.nextTick()`, the callback is executed immediately after the current operation completes but before the
   event loop moves on to the next phase. This makes it a way to ensure that a function is executed at the earliest
   possible moment in the event loop.
2. **Promise:** Promises are typically executed after `process.nextTick()`. However, they are prioritized over callbacks
   scheduled with `setTimeout()`.
3. **setTimeout():** Callbacks scheduled with `setTimeout()` are placed in the timer phase of the event loop. They will
   be executed after the current operation, promises, and any previously scheduled `setTimeout()` callbacks have been
   completed.
4. **Callback:** Regular callbacks (not scheduled using `process.nextTick()`) have the lowest priority. They are
   executed after the event loop processes `process.nextTick()`, promises, and `setTimeout()` callbacks.

## **23\. What is the Factory function and generator function?**

**A factory function** in JavaScript is a function **that returns an object**. It is a pattern used to create objects in
a straightforward and organized manner. **Instead of using constructor functions and the new keyword** to create new
objects, a **factory function encapsulates the object creation process and returns a new object.**

**A Generator function** in JavaScript is a special type of function **that can be paused and resumed during its
execution.**

A generator function produces a sequence of results instead of a single value.

When a generator function called **it returns a** **generator object** that can be used to control the execution of the
function by calling the next() method.

The function‚Äôs code can be paused within the body using the **yield keyword**, and it can later be resumed from the
exact point where it was paused.

This provides a powerful mechanism for creating iterators and handling asynchronous code.

## **24\. Different ways to clone (Shallow and deep copy of object) an object?**

**A shallow copy** is a copy of an object whose **references are the same** as the original object. This means that if
you change the value of a property in the shallow copy, it will also change the value of the property in the original
object.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="d0c2" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> user = {  
    <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Kingsley"</span>,  
    <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">28</span>,  
    <span class="hljs-attr">job</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Web Developer"</span>  
}  
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> clone = user</span></pre>

**A deep copy** is a copy of an object whose **references are not the same** as the original object. This means that if
you change the value of a property in the deep copy, it will not change the value of the property in the original
object.

there different ways to create deep copy of an object.

a)**JSON.parse and JSON.stringify**: useful for nested object also.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"> <span id="04cc" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> originalObject = { <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Alice"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">25</span> };  
   <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> deepCopy = <span class="hljs-title.class">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-title.class">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">stringify</span>(originalObject));</span></pre>

d)**Object.assign():** the `Object.assign()` method should be used to deep copy objects that have no nested objects.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="638c" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> originalObject = { <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Alice"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">25</span> };

## **25\. How to make an object immutable? (seal and freeze methods)?**

In JavaScript, you can make an object immutable using the Object.seal() and Object.freeze() methods.

**Object.freeze()**: (**Completely Immutable)** this method freezes an object, making it both sealed and marking all its
properties as read-only. After freezing an object, its properties cannot be modified, added, or removed.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"> <span id="d269" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj = { <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Alice'</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">25</span> };  
     <span class="hljs-title.class">Object</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">freeze</span>(obj);  
     obj.<span class="hljs-property">name</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'Bob'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Not allowed</span>  
     obj.<span class="hljs-property">address</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'123 Street'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Not allowed</span>  
     <span class="hljs-keyword">delete</span> obj.<span class="hljs-property">age</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Not allowed</span></span></pre>

**Object.seal(): (Partialy Immutable)** this method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added and
marking all existing properties as non-configurable. However, you can still modify the values of existing properties
that are writable.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"> <span id="77de" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj = { <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Alice'</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">25</span> };  
     <span class="hljs-title.class">Object</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">seal</span>(obj);  
     obj.<span class="hljs-property">name</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'Bob'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Allowed</span>  
     obj.<span class="hljs-property">address</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'123 Street'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Not allowed (no new properties can be added)</span>  
     <span class="hljs-keyword">delete</span> obj.<span class="hljs-property">age</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Not allowed (existing properties cannot be deleted)</span></span></pre>

## **26\. What is Event and event flow, event bubbling and event capturing?**

In JavaScript, Event flow is the order in which an event like a click or a keypress is received on the web page or
handled by the web browser. There are two phases in event flow: event capturing and event bubbling.

When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination
or target element, **it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first**, starting at the top with
the global window object.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="46c9" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><div <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"parent"</span>>  
  <button <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"child"</span>>Click me!</button>  
</div></span></pre>

Now, let‚Äôs explain event flow with this example:

1. **Event Capturing Phase:** When you click the button, the event starts its journey from the top (the root of the
   document) and moves down to the target element. In this case, it travels from the document‚Äôs root to the `<div>` (
   parent element), then to the `<button>` (child element). This is called the capturing phase.
2. **Event Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element, which is the `<button>` in this case.
3. **Event Bubbling Phase:** After reaching the target, the event starts bubbling up. It goes from the `<button>` back
   to the `<div>` and eventually to the root of the document. This is called the bubbling phase.

Here‚Äôs a simple JavaScript code snippet to see this in action:

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="3925" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-variable.language">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'parent'</span>).<span class="hljs-title.function">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>() {  
  <span class="hljs-variable.language">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Div clicked (capturing phase)'</span>);  
}, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// The 'true' here indicates capturing phase.</span></span></pre>

<pre class="qd pv pr qe qf ax qg bj"><span id="1927" class="nf ng fr pr b hl qh qi l qj qc" data-selectable-paragraph="">document.getElementById('child').addEventListener('click', function() {  
  console.log('Button clicked (target phase)');  
});</span><span id="33fb" class="nf ng fr pr b hl qm qi l qj qc" data-selectable-paragraph="">document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function() {  
  console.log('Div clicked (bubbling phase)');  
});</span></pre>

When you click the button, you‚Äôll see these messages in the console in the following order:

1. ‚ÄúDiv clicked (capturing phase)‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúButton clicked (target phase)‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúDiv clicked (bubbling phase)‚Äù

## **27\. What is Event delegation?**

Event delegation is a JavaScript programming technique **that optimizes event handling for multiple elements.**

Instead of attaching an event listener to each individual element, event delegation involves attaching a single event
listener to a common ancestor element that is higher up in the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy.

When an event occurs on one of the descendant elements, it ‚Äúbubbles up‚Äù to the common ancestor, where the event listener
is waiting.

**Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of
the events** that happen inside it.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="1944" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> form = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">querySelector</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"#registration-form"</span>);</span></pre>

<pre class="qd pv pr qe qf ax qg bj"><span id="82c3" class="nf ng fr pr b hl qh qi l qj qc" data-selectable-paragraph="">// Listen for changes to fields inside the form  
form.addEventListener(  
  "input",  
  function (event) {  
    // Log the field that was changed  
    console.log(event.target);  
  },  
  false  
);</span></pre>

## **28\. What are server-sent events?**

Server-sent events (SSE) are a simple and efficient technology for enabling **real-time updates from the server to the
client** over a **single HTTP connection.**

SSE allows the server to push data to the web client (usually a browser) as soon as new information is available, making
it an excellent choice for scenarios where you need real-time updates without relying on complex protocols or
third-party libraries.

a)SSE provides a **unidirectional flow of data from the server to the client**. The server initiates the communication,
sending updates to clients.

b)SSE **uses a text-based protocol,** which means that data sent from the server to the client is typically in a text
format (usually JSON or plain text).

c)SSE handles reconnection automatically.

d)SSE establishes a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing the server to send a stream of
events to the client. Each event can have a unique type and data associated with it.

e)**The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications.** For example, you can receive messages
from server as below,

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="39ae" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> <span class="hljs-title.class">EventSource</span> !== <span class="hljs-string">"undefined"</span>) {  
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> source = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title.class">EventSource</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"sse_generator.js"</span>);  
  source.<span class="hljs-property">onmessage</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">event</span>) {  
    <span class="hljs-variable.language">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"output"</span>).<span class="hljs-property">innerHTML</span> += event.<span class="hljs-property">data</span> + <span class="hljs-string">"<br>"</span>;  
  };  
}</span></pre>

f)Below are the list of events (onopen, onmessage,onerror) available for server-sent events.

## **29\. What is a web worker or service worker in javascript?**

Web Workers and Service Workers are two different concepts in JavaScript,

**Web Workers are designed for concurrent JavaScript execution** in the background, while **Service Workers are used for
creating Progressive Web Apps with offline capabilities** and advanced features. Both are essential tools for enhancing
the performance and functionality of web applications.

Each serves a distinct purpose in web development:

## Web Workers:

1. **Concurrency:** **Web Workers are a browser feature** that allows you to run JavaScript code in the background, *
   *separate from the main browser thread.** This enables concurrent execution of tasks without blocking the user
   interface.
2. **Use Cases:** Web Workers are commonly used for tasks that are computationally intensive or time-consuming, such as
   data processing, image manipulation, or complex calculations. By running these tasks in a separate thread, they don‚Äôt
   impact the responsiveness of the web page.
3. **Communication:** Web Workers can **communicate with the main thread using a messaging system**. They can send and
   receive messages, allowing for coordination between the main thread and the worker.
4. **Browser Support:** Web Workers are supported in most modern browsers.

## Service Workers:

1. **Offline Capabilities:** Service Workers are a more advanced feature used for creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
   They act as proxy servers that run in the background and can intercept and cache network requests. This enables
   offline capabilities, such as serving cached content when the user is offline.
2. **Use Cases:** Service Workers are primarily used for implementing features like **offline access,** **push
   notifications, and background sync.** They enable web apps to function even when there‚Äôs no internet connection.
3. Lifecycle: Service Workers have their own lifecycle with events like `install`, `activate`, and `fetch`. They are
   typically registered at the beginning of a web app's life.
4. Browser Support: Service Workers are supported in modern browsers and are a key technology for creating reliable and
   engaging web applications.

## 30\. How to compare 2 JSON objects in javascript?

a) One simple way to compare two JSON objects is to use JSON.stringify to convert them into strings and then compare the
strings.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="1c72" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title.function">areEqual</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj1, obj2</span>) {  
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title.class">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">stringify</span>(obj1) === <span class="hljs-title.class">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">stringify</span>(obj2);  
}  

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj1 = { <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> } };  
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj2 = { <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> } };  
<span class="hljs-variable.language">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">log</span>(<span class="hljs-title.function">areEqual</span>(obj1, obj2)); <span class="hljs-comment">// Output: true</span></span></pre>

b) You can use the Ramda library to compare two JSON objects as well. Ramda provides a function called equals for this
purpose.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="28c6" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> R = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ramda'</span>);  

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj1 = { <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> } };  
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj2 = { <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> } };  

<span class="hljs-variable.language">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">log</span>(R.<span class="hljs-title.function">equals</span>(obj1, obj2)); <span class="hljs-comment">// Output: true</span></span></pre>

c) Another option is to use a library, such as Lodash, that provides a method for deep comparison of objects.

<pre class="pa pb pc pd pe pv pr pw bo px ba bj"><span id="e778" class="py ng fr pr b bf pz qa l qb qc" data-selectable-paragraph=""><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> _ = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'lodash'</span>);  

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj1 = { <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> } };  
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj2 = { <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> } };  
<span class="hljs-variable.language">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title.function">log</span>(_.<span class="hljs-title.function">isEqual</span>(obj1, obj2)); <span class="hljs-comment">// Output: true</span></span></pre>
